# Rhythm-Tracker

This project uses SFML 2.5.1 to get the samples from an audio file.

The current up-to-date executable can be found in the debug folder.

Rhythm Tracker is a program where after you give it a recording of you playing an instrument, it can give you a visualization of how accurately you played the notes to a tempo that it detects. Right now, the program consists of algorithms to detect and analyze the accuracies of each note and a simple graph displaying color coded bars for each note in that audio file. In the future, I have plans to create a GUI for the user to type in the file name and start the note accuracy analysis, and also to make the display graph more interactive.
