# Rhythm-Tracker

This project uses SFML 2.5.1 to get the samples from an audio file.

The current up-to-date executable can be found in the debug folder.

Rhythm Tracker is a program where after you give it a recording of an instrument being played, it can give a visualization of how accurately the notes were played to a tempo that it detects. Right now, the program consists of algorithms to detect and analyze the accuracies of each note and a simple graph displaying color coded bars for each note in that audio file. In the future, I have plans to create a GUI for the user to type in the file name and start the note accuracy analysis, and also to make the display graph more interactive by allowing the user to get detailed information about each note by hovering over the bars.
