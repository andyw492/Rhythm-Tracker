User story/study:

The user study that we conducted tied in with the whole Agile process and it helped us out a lot because it gave us a lot of new ideas on how to provide the best experience to the user in the final product. At the time of us doing the user study, we didn't really have a complete version of the website for the users to interact with, so we came up with the idea to show the users these website designs we drew on Figma and have them give feedback on the designs.

In this part of the project, we collaborated by writing the user stories shown on the left and coming up with tasks for the user study together, and we also had good teamwork when we conducted the actual user studies. When we met with our users, we split into teams of two where one person talked to the user and asked them questions about the website and another person wrote down the feedback that was given by the user.

Photos page:

Another feature that we have on our website is that the user can look at ISS photos that other people have taken using this site and they can also share the photos that they take so that other people can look at them using the website. All of this happens on the photos page, which is being shown right now.

In the middle of the page is our photo carousel: it can store up to 10 photos, and you can navigate between the photos by clicking on the left and right arrows or by clicking the boxes below.

If the user wants to upload their photos to the carousel, they can use the share an image button on the bottom, so all they have to do is click on it and then choose the picture that they want to upload.

The API that we used to upload and retrieve photos is the Gyazo API, and the way we store the photos that are sent to the website is by uploading them through the API to a Gyazo account that I created
